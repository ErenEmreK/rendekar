# Rendekar Video Player
Rendekar is a web-based video player project that provides interactive translations for subtitles, for the people using movies and series as their primary language learning method. But since web browsers naturally do not support '.mkv' -and i couldn't find a way to work it out, -thinking .mkv support is a very important part of the project- i decided to take a break and complete it as a native desktop app later.  

**1-**  It's not usable now.
**2-** I don't actually use JS too much, so it may be pain for eyes.
**3-** I have no idea when i will be available to work on it. :/
